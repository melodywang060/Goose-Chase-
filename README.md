# Goose-Chase

Many of you recall the difficulty of navigating college websites during the college application process, or remember your own university's website. 

There are links that lead to everywhere, and links that lead to nowhere

Instead of reconstructing the cmu website, which is infamous for having a complicated web of links, we have decided to remedy this issue by encouraging students and faculty to get familiar with the cmu website via a game!

Our game, Goose Chase, is structured like WikiRaces, a game where you begin on one web page and traverse through a series of links to end up on a pre-determined end page.

---
The theme behind the game is based on the most prominent birds of CMU, such as Honk & Chonk the Goose, Polly the Parrot, and Duo the Owl. Your objective is to guide these birds from their random starting points to their homes.

--- 
The website is structured so that players can play with other players by creating race rooms. Players can create their own usernames and choose a fun bird to play as. you can actually see these birds in our bird gallery, where bird has its own personality and a matching college at CMU!

We hope that through this game, the CMU community will be able to navigate through any page that they require with less difficulty, as well as have fun with friends as they explore new pages!
